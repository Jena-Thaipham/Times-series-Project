This project investigates Canadian immigration patterns using the CANSIM 051-0004 dataset, which includes data on immigrants by province or territory from 1971 to 2023, alongside demographic indicators such as births, deaths, emigrants, and returning emigrants. Released by Statistics Canada on September 25, 2024, the dataset provides a comprehensive foundation for analyzing and forecasting immigration trends.

The study conducts a comparative analysis of multiple forecasting models, spanning traditional time series techniques and advanced machine learning-based approaches. Model performance is rigorously evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Among the traditional methods, the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) model demonstrated superior performance, effectively capturing short-term variations in the data. Additionally, the hybrid model developed in this study, combining XGBoost with ARIMA, emerged as the most accurate forecasting approach overall. These results highlight the advantages of blending statistical and machine learning models, offering valuable insights into the complex dynamics of immigration trends and supporting informed decision-making for Canadaâ€™s demographic planning.
